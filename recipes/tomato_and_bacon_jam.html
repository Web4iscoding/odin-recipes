    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a sweet-savory recipe you don't want to miss. 
        According to recipe creator 3RDTIMESACHARM, this meaty 
        tomato jam works well on everything from grilled cheese to eggs.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound smoked bacon</li>
        <li>2 pounds ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 yellow sweet onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the 
            bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon when cool.</li>
        <li>Stir tomatoes, sweet onion, sugar, apple cider vinegar, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce together in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve sugar. Stir in crumbled bacon and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the spread is
             very thick, about 1 hour. Adjust salt and black pepper.</li>    
        <li>Cool and spoon into a 1-pint glass jar with a lid; keeps refrigerated for 1 week or frozen for 2 months. If freezing, put spread into small
             jars and let jars thaw in refrigerator overnight before using.</li>
    </ol>
